The gamemanager is the top life script file that manages allll of the game logic.

I didn't put anything in it yet, as I was not sure how our game was going to work but this is probably where
- list of enemies
- level loading /transition 
- endgame start game (spawn locations) (maybe?)
- health and death
- other game system things

will go. We should really start working on that SOOOON...

Finally Loader is a file that initiallizes the GameManager when the game starts... Im not sure why exactly we need this but
the tutorial had it so.

Both GameManager and Loader will be attached to a GameManager object that will always remain in every ]
scene of the game.
